# ICU-EDA-with-MIMIC-IV
This repository contains my final project for AIDL03 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I worked with the MIMIC-IV clinical dataset. The goal of this project is to explore ICU stays and prescriptions, analyze patient outcomes, and answer meaningful research questions using data science techniques.
